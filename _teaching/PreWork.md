# Hello

Welcome to the Prep work Summer 2017 offered by Cornell Tech under the supervision of Prof. Vitaly Shmatikov. 
Extra course material will be shared via a Google drive folder.`

## Schedule

- [Algorithms and Data Structures: Stanford 106B](https://see.stanford.edu/Course/CS106B), we expect you to complete the course in a pace of 4 lectures per week.
     * Problem sets, solutions and videos are available online. 
     * TA will hold weekly office hour.
     * **Assignment**: Since the 106B libirary is not updated for current version of Xcode, we suggest doing the assignments from the latest 106B website : [Stanford 106B 2016 winter](http://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs106b/cs106b.1164/). You can test your code online.
     * Please turn in your assignment to the TA via email. **Deadline is every Wednesday 12 pm EST starting May. 24th.**

## Office Hours

1. In General 

   - The first half 30 minutes of the office hour will be me talking about the section problem sets from 2016 winter 106B. You don't have to do those problems, but it will be good if you can take a look at them.
   - The second 30 minutes will be people asking questions. 

   There will be two office hours in every week. The first 30 minutes will cover the same thing in the two office hours, also if people asked some questions that I think might be helpful to others, I'll email everyone.
   In conclusion, if you miss one of the office hours, it's totally fine. Also you are welcome to join any time during the office hour.
